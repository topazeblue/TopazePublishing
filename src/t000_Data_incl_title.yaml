abstract: |
  Topaze Publishing ("TP") is a collection of Python libraries destined to create
  beautiful and modular papers, mostly from augmented markdown sources, ie markdown 
  files with a yaml header for metadata. The python libraries mostly deal with the 
  creation of the aggregated and augmented markdown file, and possibly its conversion
  to html. They then invoke pandoc for conversion into other formats, including Word,
  LaTeX and ultimately pdf.
