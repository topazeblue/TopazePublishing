Automated Market Makers, short AMMs, are smart contracts that autonomously make markets in tokens on a blockchain, in particular the Ethereum blockchain. We will in the years to come see a convergence between traditional finance ("TradFi") and the emerging decentralized finance ("DeFi"), and whilst it is too early to understand where it will end up, it is highly likely that AMMs will play a central role in this convergence.

AMMs, like trading venues in traditional finance, are places where assets change owners. That means they are in the center of the financial system -- without them the financial system could not exist. They are also highly complex entities, both in their own right, and in their interaction with other parts of the system. This is the reason why we are currently working on The AMM Book ([theammbook.org](https://theammbook.org)) - it is important for everyone, especially in the TradFi and regulatory community who have not yet been exposed to the topic, to understand what those AMMs are and how they work.

<!--WT=PAGEBREAK-->

The book covers AMM from various different angles -- their technical implementation, their economics, their regulation, and, last but certainly not least, their internal mechanics. AMMs are following a passive trading strategy: they offer to trade with everyone who approaches them, on the terms determined by their internal algorithms. It is well-known since Black, Scholes and Merton wrote their seminal papers [Black Scholes 73, Merton 73] that trading strategies and financial derivatives are closely related. This suggests -- and it turns out this is true -- that the quantitative finance apparatus that underpins modern option pricing theory is very well suited to study AMMs.

We reserved a chapter in our book describing and reviewing the quantitative finance aspects of Automated Market Makers. This is a highly specialst topic that is covered both by industry practitioners and by academics in the world's leading universities, with those two groups exhibiting a significant overlap. The primary vehical for advancing knowledge in that world are peer-reviewed papers. We therefore decided to publish this chapter independently from the book so that the community can review it -- and to publish it as early as possible so that at the time the book is ready for publication the paper has undergone a thorough review and revision process.

Without further ado, please let us thank you for reading this paper and please, do contact us with any comments, suggestions and in particular errors.
